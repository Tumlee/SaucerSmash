# How to play

* MOVE your saucer around. (W, A, S, D)
* Go into OVERDRIVE to move faster. (Right Mouse)
* FIRE bolts at enemy saucers to shut off their shields and stall their engines (Left mouse)
* DESTROY enemy saucers by charging into them with Overdrive while their sheilds are down.
* Do NOT touch an enemy while their shield is still up, or your saucer will be destroyed.
* You can also OVERDRIVE TOWARDS YOUR MOUSE CURSOR to ensure accuracy with your kills. (Space bar)
* If you are not Overdriving, hitting an enemy will KNOCK THEM AWAY.
	You can take advantage of this by knocking enemies into one another.
* Stun multiple enemies at once and destroy them in one COMBO to gain bonus points.
* If you see enemies with a target circling them, destroy them immediately.
	If they are left to live, they will gain extra abilities and become EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.
	
# Configuration files and replays

Configuration files and replays are stored in %appdata%\Saucersmash\ under Windows and under .local\share\SaucerSmash under Linux.
Under Windows, Replay (.ssr) files can be 'opened with' Saucersmash, or clicked and dragged on top of SaucerSmash.exe, to play them back
To do the same thing under Linux, simply run './saucersmash path/to/replay.ssr'
